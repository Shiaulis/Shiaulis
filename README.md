### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andrius. Iâ€™m an iOS Developer at Pipedrive, working on our awesome mobile client. In 2015 Iâ€™ve decided to dramatically change my work. IT and software development was interesting for me for the whole life but since I had no CS-related education, I thought it is impossible to become a developer. Nevertheless, I became a software tester and in 2 years started to work as a software developer.

Development wise the most interesting topics for me are: SwiftUI, Combine, Accessibility, Siri integration. I'm open for any collaboration with side projects of other developers, since I'm looking for a ways to improve my skills outside of my regular work. Do not hesitate to ping me if you have any questions/advises/propositions
